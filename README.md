📦 Amazon Style Clone

A static Amazon-inspired e-commerce web page built using HTML & CSS — replicating the look and feel of the Amazon homepage with product sections, navigation, banners, and responsive layout.

This project is designed for learning front-end development and practicing real-world UI design by cloning the structure of a major e-commerce site for skill improvement.
